# Structuring IPFS Research

@jbenet and a few other people (sorry, i failed to capture names) got together to talk about how to structure IPFS Research. 
We looked over the past (ipfs/notes and more), and we looked at what Filecoin Research has been doing.
We discussed the kinds of problems a research group like this might look into, and we discussed how to get started.


## Filecoin Research

- http://research.filecoin.io
- https://github.com/filecoin-project/research <-- explore this thoroughly

Filecoin Research has structured a lab that includes deep cryptography theory work, 
practical implementations of constructions, and study through various forms of analysis, simulation, and testing.
The project has gained the leverage to solve very hard problems by taking Research Management seriously.
We need the same kind of leveraged attention in IPFS and libp2p.

## Towards IPFS Research

- we need to form a group
- we need people with full time or half time attention into problems
- we need to someone to lead the group
- we need to span a lot: fundamental research questions, to more practical prototyping, to simulations and so on.
- we need to learn about Research Management and how to do it
   - learn from Filecoin Research -- @nicola and others
   - learn from PL Research -- @miyazono @jsoares and others 
   - learn from Ethereum Research
   - learn from other groups
- we have hard questions around network scaling (eg content routing) that are good examples to use.
