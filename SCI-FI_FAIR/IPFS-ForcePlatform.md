# What is the NAME of your project?
IPFS-Force Storage Sharing Platform

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
IPFS provides a wonderful series of protocols and products to build us decentralized storage network, 
however, in the open-source world, there is no SLA or incentive mechanism to connect business usage, 
and there is not a way to use traditional storage access API to access IPFS network. 
By developing a new layer above IPFS, we could connect any storage provider using IPFS to connect in the network 
under a uniform management system, in which the service level is evaluated, and data saving quality is guaranteed, 
based on the service level and quality, we set up the incentive layer to connect the storage users and providers. 
With this system, more services could be provided, such as data redundancy, data security.

- to be updated soon

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
This system is on trial now. Once it is deployed, IPFS-based applications or services providers will not need to deploy 
their own stable IPFS platform, since IPFS-Force will provide a stable decentralized sharing storage with quality.
