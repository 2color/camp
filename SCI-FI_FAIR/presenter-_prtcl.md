# What is the NAME of your project?
[_Prtcl](http://www.uprtcl.io)

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
The Underscore Protocol ([_Prtcl](http://www.uprtcl.io)) is like GIT, but for ideas. It is a platform-agnostic content co-creation protocol.

With the _Prtcl, any piece of content can be forked, mutated, reused or combined with other content by anyone, on any platform. All of this without loosing the traces, links and full history of each piece of content.

For the IPFS Sci-fi event, we will be giving access to the first distributed, unstopabble, and censorship resistant shared conference notepad. Similar to this very same repository ([ipfs/camp](https://github.com/ipfs/camp)), but powered by ETHEREUM, IPFS and the \_PRTCL instead of GIT.

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
- PEPO OSPINA (pepo@collectiveone.org)
- GUILLEM CÃ“RDOBA (guillem@collectiveone.org).

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
We will need a table where we can setup our "customer service support": A place people can go if they are having trobles with the prototype or have questions regarding it.

# Do you have a LOGO/HERO IMAGE for the main projector?

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
nope
