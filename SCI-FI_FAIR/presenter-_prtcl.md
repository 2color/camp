# What is the NAME of your project?
[_Prtcl](http://www.uprtcl.io)

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
Like GIT, but for ideas. The Underscore Protocol ( [_Prtcl](http://www.uprtcl.io) ) is a platform-agnostic content co-creation protocol.

With the _Prtcl, any piece of content can be:

- Organized, reused and combined with other content, by any user, on any platform.
- Forked and mutated by anyone.
- Controlled and governed by multiple authors.

We will be showcasing an MVP with content being created and mutated by different users on different platforms, including IPFS, Holochain, Ethereum and a Web Server.


# WHO will PRESENT the project?
- PEPO OSPINA (pepo@collectiveone.org)
- GUILLEM CÃ“RDOBA (guillem@collectiveone.org).
