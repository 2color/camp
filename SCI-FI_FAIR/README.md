# ðŸ§¬ Sci-Fi Fair

## Description

Do you fancy Science Fairs? Always felt that there was something missing? Something even more futuristic? Despair no more and welcome to the ðŸ§¬ IPFS Camp Sci-Fi Fair ðŸ›¸. The Sci-Fi fair was created to give a free roaming space for all our attendees to meet the awesome projects from other event attendees.

## Instructions

### Application Process
TBW

### Presenters

If you've been selected as a presenter, please be sure to fill out this [rider form](https://forms.gle/YZ7iA71fKUcCgTCy6) so your project can be presented in the best possible light.

You'll need to bring (at minimum) a PC/laptop to present your project. We will provide a power hookup, a monitor (on request), and potentially other small supplies: if you have an interesting presentation ideas, let us know! This isn't meant to be a boring old poster session (not to be confused with the [not-at-all-boring Poster Projects](../../POSTER_PROJECTS/README.md)) so **be creative!** You can also bring swag for your project, within reason (stickers, patches, etc)

A projector will be running a slideshow in the room throughout the event, so please provide a logo, promo image, or short clip/animation (<10s) that we can include.

The fair runs for 2 hours (1630-1830) on the last day of the conference, which is the same time as the Unconf, so you may want to assign 2-3 people in shifts (if possible) so everyone gets a chance to walk around and see everything else.

### Everyone Else

If you're just visiting, relax, check out the projects, and don't be shy! Everyone standing by a table is dying to hear your questions, seriously.


### Overview

- **Objective**: Give a wide selection of projects (internal PL work and community members) to present their work in a relaxed environment, so every attendee can engage with projects they are particularly interested in on their own time, as well as see a broader overview of the ecosystem than is possible in a strictly chronological single-stream presentation format
- **Activity**: Presenters operate a smnall "station" showcasing their project, usually in an interactive and engaging way. Attendees can wander around at their leisure.
- **Outcome**: Many new relationships formed. People learn about projects both new and old.

### How

1-2 dozen tables, each presenting a project. Fair runs for 2 hours on Saturday (1630-1830), opposite the [Unconference](../../UNCONF/README.md)

### FAQ

Q: What if I'm the only rep of my project at the Camp? Can I walk away from my station/see the Unconf?

A: No problem! We ask you to be in attendance for at least a full hour of the fair. After that, your project can be in a more autonomous/self-explanatory mode (it may help to print a supplementary explanation for when you're away, too)
